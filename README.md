# AdventOfCode2018
This is where I'll sore my solutions for the [AdventOfCode2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) programming challenge.
The Advent Of Code is a fun little set of puzzles laid out in the style of an Advent calendar that you can solve with programming. Find out more here at its [about page](https://adventofcode.com/2018/about).

## Structure
I'll be laying this out in directories named day# with solution files for each part of the challenge. IE: 
```
day1/
├── day1_part1.py
├── day1_part2.py
├── day1_input.txt

```

## Schedule
I'll be posting my solution after I've completed it or after the leaderboard for that day is full (whichever is later).

## Don't Cheat
Seriously, don't use my solutions to "solve" the Advent of code challenges. That's not in line with the spirit of the challenge.
Do your own work. Learning and growing through code is the biggest reward in doing this.
